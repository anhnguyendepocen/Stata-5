% Reshape Data

mi set flong % Reshape the data - "flong" is needed for multiple imputation with multilevel modelling

% Register Imputations

mi register regular x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x10 x12 % Register variables that do NOT need imputation
mi register imputed x8 x9 x11 x13 /// 
x14 x15 x16 x17 % Register variables that have missing data and require imputation


mi describe % Provide summary statistics on those regular and imputed variables

% 1st Imputation - Add one varibale to be imputed
% Following Imputations - Add additional variables

% mi impute [variables to be imputed] = dependent variable [variables that do NOT need to be imputed]

mi impute chained (logit, augment) x8 x9 x11 x13 /// % "logit" is used because these variables to be imputed are binary
(ologit, augment) x14 x15 /// % "ologit" is used as these variables are ordinal 
x16 x17 (ologit, augment ascontinuous) /// % If imputation fails, add "ascontinuous" to treat the categorical variable as continuous
 = y x1 x2 x3  /// & "=" is used to signal the end of the imputed variables, and move onto the regular variables
x4 x5 x6 x7 x10 x12, add(5) rseed(2233) by(country, noreport) dots % "add(5) refers to computing 5 imputations
